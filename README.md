## Problem Statement

Marketing campaign is a strategy to enhance business. One of the approach to sell the products/services is by telemarketing. 
Telemarketing is a marketing approach operationalized through a contact center. 
Representatives from the contact center will contact the customers by phone offer the products. The cost of telemarketing is variative, based on per hour or per lead. 
This approach is commonly done by banking service companies to offer their products, for example long-term deposit. 
To determine whether a campaign is successful or not is based on how many customers decide to subscribe the long-term deposit. 

However, if we talk about the cost of the telemarketing, sometimes it can be costly if the marketing 
team just call all the customers without knowing that they might be not interested to subscribe to the 
long-term deposit also waste time as well. Besides, this strategy makes the customers uncomfortable, especially the ones who don't 
want to subscribe to our product. To overcome with the campaign cost waste and customers' complaint, it is needed a prediction on how many
customers are more likely to subscribe the deposit so we can calculate the campaign cost from the prediction.
